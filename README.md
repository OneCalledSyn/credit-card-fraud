Credit Card Fraud and Random Forests

Dataset of credit card transactions, which are labeled either fraudulent or legitimate. 
Random forest is used for building the optimal predictive model for binary classification of the training set.
F1 statistic is used to evaluate how well the model is performing against the test set.
A bigger dataset would have been more ideal, but due to personal computer performance issues, the size had to be trimmed.
